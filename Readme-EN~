IR Remote Control Pyduino

It is an application that combines the genius of:
python, arduino and infrared signal to control
any device that uses this type of technology
achieved through a user interface.

This program has been developed mainly in fedora 20 for verifying the HDMI ports on the TV Haier.
It is for this reason that only solves some use cases.

It is noteworthy that we have used the siguietes modules:

PySerial - For communication with Arduino
PyQt4 - For the GUI

The C library for sending and recpcion IR codes
Arduino-IrRemote-master


The main objective is to build a large repository
codes of different devices using the infrared signal.

Still a long way to go.
